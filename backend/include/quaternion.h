/**
 * @class Quaternion
 * @brief Mathematical representation of a 3D rotation using unit quaternions.
 *
 * This class represents an orientation quaternion used to describe the
 * rotation between an inertial reference frame and a body-fixed frame.
 *
 * The quaternion is enforced to be a unit quaternion (‖q‖ = 1) at all times.
 * This invariant is critical because only unit quaternions represent pure
 * rotations without scaling. Any deviation from unit norm would lead to
 * non-orthogonal rotation matrices and unphysical behavior.
 *
 * The class is deliberately kept free of any physical or numerical integration
 * logic. It only encapsulates mathematical properties and guarantees internal
 * consistency. Time integration and dynamics are handled externally.
