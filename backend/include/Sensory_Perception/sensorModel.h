/**
 * @class SensorModel
 * @brief Abstract base class for spacecraft sensor model implementations.
 *
 * SensorModel extends the generic ISensor interface and represents a
 * configurable collection of onboard measurement algorithms. Implementations
 * derive observable quantities from the physical simulation state without
 * modifying it.
 *
 * A SensorModel may aggregate multiple virtual instruments such as
 * accelerometers, altimeters, gyroscopes or fuel gauges. Concrete subclasses
 * can introduce effects like noise, bias, filtering or delay to emulate
 * realistic hardware behavior.
 *
 * This layer forms the perception boundary between the physical simulation
 * (ground truth) and the spacecraft’s instrumentation or telemetry output.
