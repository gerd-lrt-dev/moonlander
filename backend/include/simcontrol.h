/**
 * @class simcontrol
 * @brief Central simulation orchestrator.
 *
 * SimControl is responsible for coordinating all high-level control flow of the simulation.
 * It does not perform physics calculations itself, but manages the interaction between
 * the major subsystems.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Collect and forward user input commands
 * - Query and apply automation / autopilot commands
 * - Resolve command priority (user vs. automation)
 * - Trigger and sequence simulation time steps
 * - Notify and update the UI / frontend state
 *
 * In short, SimControl decides *who controls the spacecraft* and *when the simulation advances*,
 * while the actual physics and state changes are handled by the spacecraft and its subsystems.
