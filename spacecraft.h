     * relative to a reference safe landing energy.

     *      KE = 0.5 * total_mass * v^2

     *          - total_mass = emptyMass + fuelMass
     *          - v = vertical velocity at impact [m/s]

     * 2. Define a reference kinetic energy (KE_ref) corresponding to a safe landing:
     *      KE_ref = 0.5 * total_mass * v_safe^2
     *      where:
     *          - v_safe = maximum safe landing velocity
     *
     * 3. Compute proportional damage:
     *      damage_percent = KE / KE_ref
     *
     * 4. Update spacecraft integrity:
     *      new_integrity = old_integrity - damage_percent
     *      Integrity is clamped to [0, 1].
     *
     * 5. Update operational status:
     *      spacecraftIsOperational = (new_integrity >= structuralIntegrity)
